# hello-world
quite literal really

I'm a painting, soccer, and warm weather enthusiast
residing in sunny Vermont.

I studied Mathematics with Computer Science (Theoretical Computer Science) at MassTech, 
and occasionally cook gourmet dinners.

I'm currently working on a team trying to better understand trips from "big" data.

My current "non-academic" interests include history of human interaction, 
debating soccer tactics, and trying to figure out how to disrupt existing 
markets with innovation.
