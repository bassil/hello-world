# hello-world
quite literal really

I'm a painting, soccer, and warm weather enthusiast
residing in sunny MA.

I studied Mathematics with Computer Science (Theoretical Computer Science) at MassTech, 
and occasionally cook gourmet dinners.

Most recently, I worked on a team trying to better understand trips from "big" data.

My current "non-academic" interests include history of human interaction, 
debating soccer tactics, and whether 42 is really the answer to the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.
